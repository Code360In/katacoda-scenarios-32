Create a file named "DockerFile" as follows:

<pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace">
# Use the latest debian linux image as a parent image
FROM debian:latest

# Create a folder 
RUN mkdir testing

# Run the command echo "hello" when the container is launched
CMD ["echo", "Hello"]
</pre>

RUN vs. CMD
* **RUN** lets you execute commands inside  your Docker image. The command executs once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer.

* **CMD** lets you define a default command to run when your container starts. E.g. start your web applicationâ€™s app server when the image is run (only one CMD command in the DockerFile).


Wait until the above updates are saved. 

Build the docker image:

`docker build -t myimage .`{{execute}}


Check that the image is created:
`docker image ls`{{execute}}


Run the docker image:

`docker run myimage`{{execute}}

If a command is provided after the image name, the specified command will be executed instead. E.g. the following command will execute 'ls -l' instead of the "echo" command.

`docker run myimage ls -l`{{execute}}

Observe that a folder "testing" is created under the / folder.
