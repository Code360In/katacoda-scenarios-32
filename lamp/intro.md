LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is a very common example of a web service stack, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components: the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), and the PHP programming language

In this lab, we will setup a LAMP in docker.
