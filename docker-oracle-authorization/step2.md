SQLPlus in Linux environment does not support using up/down arrows for accessing the previous/next command. The rlwrap utility provides a command history and editing of keyboard input for any other command. Start sqlplus with the rlwrap utility.

Login as ** system uesr.

`rlwrap sqlplus system/12345`{{execute T1}}

Show the tablespace inside the pluggable database SALESPDB.

`select tablespace_name from dba_tablespaces;`{{execute}}

We will store the data under the APP_DATA tablespace. 

As **system** user, create user mickey with password "mickey" in using APP_DATA as the default tablespace.

`create user mickey identified by mickey default tablespace APP_DATA temporary tablespace temp;`{{execute T1}}


Open another terminal (T2). 
In T2, login as mickey.

`docker exec -it oracle-xe bash`{{execute T2}}

`su oracle`{{execute T2}}

`sqlplus mickey/mickey`{{execute T2}}

The mickey account currently doesn't have "Create Session" Privilege. 
Press Ctrl+C to break out of the login program.


Switch to terminal 1. As SYSTEM user, grant micky the  "create session" permission.

`grant create session to mickey ;`{{execute T1}}


Show the granted system privileges by querying the DBA_SYS_PRIVS view.

`select * from DBA_SYS_PRIVS where GRANTEE = 'MICKEY';`{{execute T1}}


Describe the DBA_SYS_PRIVS table to understand  more about the attributes:

`describe DBA_SYS_PRIVS`{{execute T1}}


In terminal 2, login as mickey again. The login should be successful.

`sqlplus mickey/mickey`{{execute T2}}


As mickey, create a "customers" table .

`CREATE TABLE customers(customer_id NUMBER, name VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL);`{{execute T2}}


As system user, show the system privilege associated with the "RESOURCE" role.

`select * from dba_sys_privs where grantee='RESOURCE';`{{execute T1}}



Grant the Resource role to Mickey.

`grant RESOURCE to mickey;`{{execute T1}}


Verify that the role is granted successfully to mickey

`SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS WHERE GRANTEE = 'MICKEY';`{{execute T1}}


We need to ensure our new user has disk space allocated in the system to actually create or modify tables and data. To grant micky 1Mb of quota, 

`ALTER USER mickey quota 1M on USERS;`{{execute T1}}

You may also grant unlimited quota to mickey as follows.

`grant unlimited tablespace to mickey;`{{execute T1}}


Logout from Mickeyâ€™s session and login again to refresh the permission.

`exit`{{execute T2}}

`sqlplus mickey/mickey`{{execute T2}}


As Mickey, try to create a "customers" table again, insert data and select from it.

`CREATE TABLE customers(customer_id NUMBER, name VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL);`{{execute}}

`INSERT into CUSTOMERS (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME) values (177,'United Continental Holdings'); `{{execute}}

`SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;`{{execute}}

Exit the sqlplus environment.
`exit`{{execute}}

Exit the docker container shell.
`exit`{{execute}}
