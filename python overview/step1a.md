A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.


<pre class="file" data-filename="demo.py" data-target="replace">
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
</pre>



Try:

`python demo.py`{{execute T1}}

A for-loop can be used for iterating over a sequence (a list, a dictionary, a set, or a string, etc).


<pre class="file" data-filename="demo.py" data-target="replace">
for x in fruits:
	print(x)
</pre>

Try:

`python demo.py`{{execute T1}}
